With a monocular camera mounted on the top of a mobile robot and looking upward to the ceiling, the robot only needs to process salient features, which greatly reduce the computational complexity and have a high accuracy. SRUKF is used instead of the standard Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to improve the linearization problem in both motion and perception models. To address the numerical instability problems in the standard SRUKF, several optimization methods are utilized in the project. \r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThis project was developed under Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, and depends on the following software:\r\n* OpenCV v2.4.3.\r\n* GSL GnuWin32 v1.8.\r\n* OpenGL.\r\n* doxygen v1.8.6.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMany thanks to Xinyuan Zhai for his previous work with this project. Thanks also to [Dr. Chen](http://www.hitsz.edu.cn/body/shizi/detailen.php?strID=488) for his supervision of this project, and the help from Baoxian Zhang.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
